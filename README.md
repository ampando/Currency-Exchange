# Currency Exchange

#### API Calls and Asynchronous Code

#### Adrienne Matosich 

## Description

This project was created to focus on practicing asynchronous code with JavaScript, and how to apply that to API calls. To demonstrate, I have created a currency exchange website. Using an exchange rate API to ensure the user receives the most recent exchange rate available. Published site is available here: [gh-pages](https://ampando.github.io/Currency-Exchange/)

## Setup/Installation Requirements  
  
  * Software Requirements:

  1. Internet Browser
  2. A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code to view, and/or edit the code base. 
  
  * To Open:

  1. Navigate to the [Currency-Exchange](https://github.com/ampando/Currency-Exchange) repository or open your terminal.
  
  2. Clone this repository using:  `git clone https://github.com/ampando/Currency-Exchange.git`
  
  3. Navigate to the `Currency-Exchange` directory in your editor of choice using `cd Currency-Exchange`.
  
  4. Open the directory with VS Code/or your editor of choice using the `code .` command.
  
  5. Create a .env file in the root directory of your cloned project. This is where your *personal* API key will be stored. 
    The .env file has already been added to the .gitignore file of this repository.
  
  6. Navigate to the [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) website. 
  
  7. Create a free account to get a free API key. 
  
  8. Copy and paste your personal API key and store it in the .env file. 
    Example: API_KEY = YOUR UNIQUE API KEY GOES HERE
  
  9. Once your API key is set up, enter `npm install` in your terminal to install all webpack plugins. When complete `npm run build` will build webpack environment. To view the project in your browser enter`npm run start`.
